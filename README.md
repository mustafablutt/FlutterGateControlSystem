# Gate Controller System




The Gate Controller System is an Internet of Things (IoT) based solution developed using the Flutter framework, aimed at providing individuals and residents of apartment complexes a seamless and convenient way of controlling and managing their gates remotely. In addition to the core gate controlling feature, the application also provides a tracking mechanism to monitor and log the entry activities in the apartment premises.

# Overview



Designed with a focus on user-friendliness, the mobile application interfaces with a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, which acts as the central control unit of the system, coupled with a 2-channel relay for gate operation. The system uses the Firebase Realtime Database to store a variable indicating the gate's status. Users can modify this variable through the application to open or close the gate. A secure login feature ensures personalized access to individual homes or apartment complex gates, enhancing the overall security and convenience of the system.





## Features

The system provides the following core features:

***Remote Gate Control:*** Control the gate status (open/close) remotely through the mobile application.

***Access Log:*** Monitor and track the entry activities within the premises of your home or apartment complex.

***Secure Access:*** Individual user accounts and secure login mechanisms ensure only authorized access to gate controls.

***Scalability:*** Designed with scalability in mind, the system is capable of integrating various IoT functionalities in the future.

***Intuitive UI:*** The user-friendly interface developed with Flutter ensures a smooth user experience.
